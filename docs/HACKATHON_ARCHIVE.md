# Hackathon Archive

This page preserves and summarizes Hedera Africa hackathon context while keeping `main` focused on Hedron's long-term product and OSS roadmap.

## Archive Branch

Full hackathon submission artifacts are maintained in:

- `hackathon/hedera-africa`

## What Is Archived There

- Submission-focused README and status material
- Pitch and video-pitch documents
- Submission guideline PDF and supporting hackathon deliverables
- Demo and judging context tied to the hackathon submission cycle

## Built For

- Hedera x402 Payment Standard bounty
- Hedera Agent Kit bounty
- Hedera Africa Hackathon submission cycle

## Mainline Continuity

Hedron remains the product identity. Mainline development is centered on:

- Hedera-native Router/Broker evolution
- Agentic commerce settlement and receipts
- Auditability via HCS
- Production integrations, reliability, and governance maturity

## Accessibility Note

Hackathon context is intentionally retained and discoverable through this page and the dedicated branch so historical documentation remains accessible without crowding ongoing product documentation.
