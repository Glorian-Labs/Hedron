# Contributing to Hedron

Thanks for contributing to Hedron by Glorian Labs.

## Development Workflow

1. Fork or branch from `main`
2. Create a focused branch (`feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`)
3. Make small, reviewable commits with clear intent
4. Run local checks before opening a PR:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run test:all
```

## Pull Request Expectations

- Keep PRs scoped to a single concern
- Include a short problem statement and approach
- Link related issues, if applicable
- Add or update docs when behavior changes
- Add tests for new behavior or bug fixes

## Commit Guidance

- Prefer conventional prefixes (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`)
- Explain why the change exists, not only what changed

## Code of Conduct

By participating, you agree to follow `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
